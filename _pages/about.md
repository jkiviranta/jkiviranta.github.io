I am a first year PhD student in Economics at KU Leuven. I study electricity markets using the tools of mechanism design and industrial organization. Currently, I want to improve our understanding of how households self-select into different tariffs in the residential electricity market. The ultimate goal of my research agenda is to understand how flexible household demand can be used to mitigate the volatility caused by intermittent generation and the limits of demand flexibility.

More broadly, I am also interested in microeconomic theory, environmental economics, and behavioral economics.

Work in progress
======
An insurance perspective into screening household electricity contracts
- In this project, I aim to build a pure risk-aversion driven model of screening household electricity contracts to rationalize the observed distribution of electricity contracts. Motivated by the behavioral insurance literature, I develop a model where high risk aversion pushes households to choose fixed price contracts over dynamic price or real-time price contracts. The electricity retailer is constrained in its pricing behavior by asymmetric information about households' divergent risk attitudes.

European electricity markets
======

I complement my research by building a website to gather the basics of the European electricity market in one place. I am inspired  by [Matching in Practice](https://matching-in-practice.com/), which does the same for European school choice mechanisms. I am also building an electricity contract comparison tool that allows anyone to estimate the cheapest contract for them given their past consumption.
