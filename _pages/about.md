I am a second year PhD student in Economics at KU Leuven. I study electricity markets using the tools of mechanism design and industrial organization. Currently, I want to improve our understanding of how households self-select into different tariffs in the residential electricity market. The ultimate goal of my research agenda is to understand how flexible household demand can be used to mitigate the volatility caused by intermittent generation and the limits of demand flexibility.

More broadly, I am also interested in microeconomic theory, environmental economics, and behavioral economics.

Work in progress
======
Risk aversion in residential electricity contract choices and design
- I study the retailer-optimal electricity pricing problem.  I formulate the problem as a screening problem, in which households are price elastic when exposed to wholesale prices and have private information regarding their heterogeneous risk aversion. The model shows how risk aversion, in particular first order risk aversion, is necessary to rationalize the large share of fixed price contracts observed in reality. This follows from the observation that price elasticity acts as partial self-insurance for the households, making them risk-loving without further assumptions on risk aversion. To showcase the applicability of first order risk averse preferences, I solve the retailer-optimal price schedule with Yaari dual utility preferences (Yaari 1987) for households and binary wholesale prices.

The role of risk aversion in the Nordic electricity market
- This project is an empricial complement to the project above. Here, I study how the Swedish and Finnish residential electricity markets react to price changes in the wholesale market, what contract types are cheapest for the average household consumption profile, and what kind of risk aversion distribution can rationalize the market shares of different contract types.

European electricity markets
======

I complement my research by building a website to gather the basics of the European electricity market in one place. I am inspired  by [Matching in Practice](https://matching-in-practice.com/), which does the same for European school choice mechanisms. I am also building an electricity contract comparison tool that allows anyone to estimate the cheapest contract for them given their past consumption.
