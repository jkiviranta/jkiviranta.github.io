I am first year doctoral researcher in Economics at KU Leuven. I study electricity markets using the tools of mechanism design and industrial organization. At the moment, I aim to increase our understanding of how households self-select into different tariffs in the residential electricity market. The ultimate goal of my research agenda is to understand how flexible household demand can be used to attenuate the volatility caused by intermittent generation, and the limits to demand flexibility.

In general I am also interested in microeconomic theory, environmental economics and behavioral economics.

Work in progress
======
An insurance perspective into screening household electricity contracts
- In this project I aim at building a purely risk-aversion driven model of screening household electricity contracts to rationalize the observed distribution of electricity contracts. Motivated by behavioral insurance literature, I develop a model where high risk-aversion pushes households to choose fixed price contracts over dynamic price or real-time price contracts. The electricity retailer is constrained in its pricing behavior by the assymetric information about the households diverging risk attitutes.

European electricity markets
======
I complement my research by building a website to gather the basics of the european electricity market in one place. I am inspired by [Matching in Practice](https://matching-in-practice.com/) that does the same for European school choice mechanisms. I am also building a tool for electricity contract comparison that would allow anyone estiamte the cheapest contract for them given their past consumption.
