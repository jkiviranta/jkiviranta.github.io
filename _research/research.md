An insurance perspective into screening household electricity contracts
- In this project I aim at building a purely risk-aversion driven model of screening household electricity contracts to rationalize the observed distribution of electricity contracts. Motivated by behavioral insurance literature, I develop a model where high risk-aversion pushes households to choose fixed price contracts over dynamic price or real-time price contracts. The electricity retailer is constrained in its pricing behavior by the assymetric information about the households diverging risk attitutes.
